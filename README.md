# Libft


The main task is to write your own library of functions for further use in projects in C.  
The Functions must be implemented in the same way as the original functions from the standard library.  
However, all functions must be protected from entering invalid data, memory leaks, false segmentation, and so on.

### Common Instruction

* Your project must be written in C.
* Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there is a norm error inside.
* Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
* All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks will be tolerated.
* If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use cc, and your Makefile must not relink.
* Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and re.
* To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile, which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h} if the subject does not specify anything else. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation is done separately.
* If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your projectâ€™s Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.
* We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work **wonâ€™t have to be submitted and wonâ€™t be graded**. It will give you a chance to easily test your work and your peersâ€™ work. You will find those tests especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
* Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during Deepthoughtâ€™s grading, the evaluation will stop.

### Mandatory Part

Program name | libft.a
----- | -------|
Turn in files | Makefile, libft.h, ft_*.c
Makefile | NAME, all clean, fclean, re
External functs. | Detailed below
Libft autorized | n/a
Description | Write your own library: a collection of functions that will be a useful tool for your cursus.

#### Technical considerations

* Declaring global variables is forbidden.
* If you need helper functions to split a more complex function, define them as static functions. This way, their scope will be limited to the appropriate file.
* Place all your files at the root of your repository.
* Turning in unused files is forbidden.
* Every .c files must compile with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
* You must use the command ar to create your library. Using the libtool command is forbidden.
* Your libft.a has to be created at the root of your repository.

### Part 1 - Libc functions

To begin, you must redo a set of functions from the libc. Your functions will have the
same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply
with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names. They
will begin with the â€™ft_â€™ prefix. For instance, strlen becomes ft_strlen.

ðŸ’¡ Some of the functionsâ€™ prototypes you have to redo use the â€™restrictâ€™ qualifier. This keyword is part of the c99 standard. It is therefore forbidden to include it in your own prototypes and to compile your code with the -std=c99 flag.

You must write your own function implementing the following original ones. They do not require any external functions:

----------- | ----------- | -----------
isalpha | toupper | bzero
isdigit | tolower | memcpy
isalnum | strchr | memmove
isascii | strrchr | strlcpy
isprint | strncmp | strlcat
strlen | memchr | strnstr
memset | memcmp | atoi

In order to implement the two following functions, you will use malloc():

calloc |
------- |
strdup |

### Other
Basic commands for compilation:
```
make (make all) - compilation of 1 part and 2 part functions  
make bonus - compilation of 1 part, 2 part and bonus part functions  
make clean - clearing *.o files  
make fclean - clearing *. o files and libraries  
```
